Elm's goal is to be the best of functional programming in the browser.

One of the primary goals of Elm is to completely eliminate runtime exceptions before they reach production by combining an aggressively helpful compiler with solid architectural principles.

Elm was designed by Evan Czaplicki as part of writing his thesis on [Concurrent FRP for Functional GUIs](http://elm-lang.org/papers/concurrent-frp.pdf).
